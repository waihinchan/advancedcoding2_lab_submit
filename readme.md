## Week 2 Exercise - Your first OF project

I found a classic project-Van Gogh's Starry Night Flow.
The core of this project lies in pixel control and class design. The flow is to unify and standardize the particle's behavior pattern by using vectors. In addition, I also learned some sampling algorithms such as poisson distribution.

## Week 4 Exercise - Python webscraper

I have learned some related python knowledge before. I have also built some automated scripts to crawl web pages. The python challenge has taught me many new ways to process and filter text, such as strings (I used regular expressions to re more). Some of the challenges are the need to use the pickle module, which provides great convenience for the secondary loading of artificial intelligence models that I will do later.
For the python web crawler, I used mongodb to store the data I crawled. Web crawlers gave me the impression that the principle is very simple, but we need to obtain the intention and logic of the web designer, which depends more on experience.

## Week 5 Exercise - Neural Networks by hand

Regarding SVM neural networks, my understanding is that in neural networks, SVM can exist as a linear layer. But what really comes into play are other activation functions and hidden layers. I don't have a deep understanding of this. In this tutorial I only learned how to write a chain rule and single layer SVM. However, I also learned about the independent SVM algorithm. I learned some knowledge about hyperplanes and related mathematical derivation. But at present I have not entered the next stage, how to use svm to fit non-linear data. I think that although the kernel is well understood, the actual amount of calculation is very large and it is confusing.
